## Multithreaded indexing for Annoy (version 1.17 or later)
## requires this define to be set
##   USE_MULTITTHREADING=-DANNOYLIB_MULTITHREADED_BUILD
## and also requires C++14 for std::shared_timed_mutex
##   CXX_STD = CXX14
## So to use multithreaded indexing, comment out the two settings
## above and make the CXX_STD below a comment. Note that it may
## alter your result (or their order) slightly due to the use of
## multithreading

## Default builds use no such define and C++11
CXX_STD = CXX11

PKG_CPPFLAGS = -I../inst/include/ ${USE_MULTITTHREADING}
