# Setting up your package 

The [\pkg{Annoy}](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) \proglang{C++} library
\citep{Github:annoy} implements a quick and simple method for _approximate nearest neighbor
(oh yeah)_ searching.  The \pkg{RcppAnnoy} package \citep{CRAN:RcppAnnoy} provides a
centralized resource for developers to use this code in their own \proglang{R} packages by
relying on \pkg{Rcpp} \citep{TAS:Rcpp,CRAN:Rcpp}. To use \pkg{Annoy} in \proglang{C++}
code,, simply put in your `DESCRIPTION` the line

```
LinkingTo: RcppAnnoy
```

and the header files will be available for inclusion into your package's source files.
Note that \pkg{Annoy} is a header-only library so no additional commands are necessary for the linker.

# Including the header files

Obviously, the header files need to be `include`d in any \proglang{C++} source file that
uses \pkg{Annoy}.  A few macros also need to be added to handle Windows-specific behaviour
and to ensure that error messages are printed through R.  The pre-processor statements in
your source files should look like:

```cpp
#if defined(__MINGW32__)
#undef Realloc
#undef Free
#endif

// define R's REprintf as the 'local' error
// print method for Annoy
#include "Rcpp.h"
#define __ERROR_PRINTER_OVERRIDE__  REprintf

#include "annoylib.h"
#include "kissrandom.h"
```

# Defining the search type 

The `AnnoyIndex` template class can accommodate different data types, distance metrics and random number generators.
Here, we will consider the most common application of a nearest-neighbor search on floating-point data with Euclidean distance.
We `typedef` the type and realized template for convenience:

```cpp
typedef float ANNOYTYPE;

typedef
AnnoyIndex<int, ANNOYTYPE, Euclidean, Kiss64Random>
MyAnnoyIndex;
```

Note that we use `float` by default, rather than the more conventional `double`.
This is chosen for speed and to be consistent with the original Python implementation.

The \pkg{Annoy} library uses random number generation during index creation
(via the `Kiss64Random` class), with a seed that is separate from R's RNG seed.
By default, the seed is fixed and results will be "deterministic" in the sense
that repeated runs on the same data will yield the same result. They will also be
unresponsive to the state of R's RNG seed. The seed used by `AnnoyIndex` can be
specified by the `set_seed` method, which should be called before adding items
to the index.

# Building an index

Let's say we have an `Rcpp::NumericMatrix` named `mat`, where each row corresponds to a sample and each column corresponds to a dimension/variable.

```cpp
const size_t nsamples=mat.nrow();
const size_t ndims=mat.ncol();
```

It is simple to build a `MyAnnoyIndex` containing the data in this matrix.
Note the copy from the double-precision matrix into a `float` vector before calling `add_item()`.

```cpp
MyAnnoyIndex obj(ndims);
// from <vector>        
std::vector<ANNOYTYPE> tmp(ndims); 
for (size_t i=0; i<nsamples; ++i) {
    Rcpp::NumericMatrix::Row cr=mat.row(i);
    // from <algorithm>
    std::copy(cr.begin(), cr.end(), tmp.begin()); 
    obj.add_item(i, tmp.data());
}
obj.build(50);
```

The `build()` method accepts an integer argument specifying the number of trees to use to
construct the index.  Indices with more trees are larger (in memory and on file) but yield
greater search accuracy.

The index can also be saved to file via

```cpp
obj.save("annoy.index");
```

and reloaded in some other context:

```cpp
MyAnnoyIndex obj2(ndims);
obj2.load("annoy.index"); // same as 'obj'.
```

This is helpful for parallelization across workers running in different \proglang{R}
sessions.  It also allows us to avoid rebuilding the index in applications where the same
data set is to be queried multiple times.

# Searching for nearest neighbors

Let's say that we want to find the `K` (approximate) nearest neighbors of sample `c` in
the original data set used to construct `obj`.  To do this, we write:

```cpp
std::vector<int> neighbor_index;
std::vector<ANNOYTYPE> neighbor_dist;
obj.get_nns_by_item(c, K + 1, -1, &neighbor_index,
                    &neighbor_dist); 
```

Upon return, the `neighbor_index` vector will be filled with the sample numbers of the `K`
nearest neighbors (i.e., rows of the original `mat`, in this case).  The `neighbor_dist`
vector will be filled with the distances to each of those neighbors.  Note that:

- We ask for the `K+1` nearest neighbors, as the set returned in `neighbor_index` will
usually include `c` itself.  This should be taken into consideration when the results are
used in downstream calculations.
- The returned neighbors are sorted by increasing distance from `c`.  However, note that
`c` itself may not necessarily be at the start if there is another point with the same
coordinates.
- `get_nns_by_item()` requires pointers to the vectors rather than the vectors themselves.
If the pointer to the output vector for distances is `NULL`, distances will not be
returned.  This provides a slight performance boost when only the identities of the
neighbors are of interest.
- The `-1` is the default value for a tuning parameter that specifies how many samples
should be collected from the trees for exhaustive distance calculations.  This defaults to
the number of trees multiplied by the number of requested neighbors; larger values will
increase accuracy at the cost of speed.

Another application is to query the index for the neighbors of a new sample given its
coordinates.  Assuming we have a `float*` to an array of coordinates of length `ndims`, we
do:

```cpp
obj.get_nns_by_vector(query, K+1, -1, 
                      &neighbor_index,
                      &neighbor_dist);                                    
```

# Further information

The [Annoy repository](https://github.com/spotify/Annoy) is the canonical source of all
things Annoying.  Questions or issues related to the \pkg{Annoy} \proglang{C++} library
itself should be posted there.  Any issues specific to the \pkg{RcppAnnoy} interface
should be posted at its separate [Github](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppannoy)
repository.  An example of using the Annoy library via \pkg{RcppAnnoy} is available in the
[\pkg{BiocNeighbors}](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocNeighbors) package
\citep{Bioc:BiocNeighbors}.
